  WHACK-A-MOLE GAME - HTML FILE
  ==============================
  
  This file defines the STRUCTURE of the game page.
  HTML = HyperText Markup Language = the skeleton/bones of your webpage.
  
  LEARNING GOALS:
  - Understand HTML document structure
  - Learn about semantic HTML elements
  - Understand how to link CSS and JavaScript files
  - Practice using IDs and classes for element selection
-->
<html lang="en">
<!-- 
  <html> = Root element of the page
  lang="en" = Language is English (helps screen readers and SEO)
-->

<head>
  <!-- 
    <head> = Contains metadata (info about the page)
    This section is NOT visible to users, but tells the browser important info
  -->
  
  <!-- 
    META CHARSET: Tells browser what character encoding to use
    UTF-8 supports all characters (emojis, special symbols, etc.)
    Always include this!
  -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  
  <!-- 
    TITLE: Shows in browser tab and bookmarks
    This is what users see when they bookmark your page
  -->
  <title>Whack-a-mole</title>
  
  <!-- 
    LINKING CSS FILE:
    =================
    - <link> = Links external resources
    - rel="stylesheet" = This is a CSS stylesheet
    - href="style.css" = Path to the CSS file (same folder)
    
    WHY IN <HEAD>?
    - CSS loads BEFORE content renders
    - Prevents "flash of unstyled content" (FOUC)
    - Users see styled page immediately
  -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"/>
  
  <!-- 
    LINKING JAVASCRIPT FILE:
    ========================
    - <script> = Loads JavaScript code
    - src="index.js" = Path to the JavaScript file
    - defer = Wait until HTML is fully loaded before running JS
    
    WHY DEFER?
    - Ensures HTML elements exist before JavaScript tries to select them
    - Prevents "Cannot read property of null" errors
    - Alternative: Put <script> at bottom of <body> (no defer needed)
  -->
  <script src="index.js" defer></script>
</head>

<body> 
  <!-- 
    <body> = Visible content of the webpage
    Everything users see goes here!
  -->
  
  <!-- 
    SCORE DISPLAY:
    =============
    - <h1> = Heading level 1 (biggest, most important heading)
    - id="score" = Unique identifier for this element
    - JavaScript will find this using: document.getElementById('score')
    - Currently shows "0", but JavaScript will update this during gameplay
  -->
  <h1 id="score">0</h1>
  
  <!-- 
    GAME BOARD CONTAINER:
    =====================
    - <div> = Generic container (like a box)
    - id="whack-a-mole" = Unique identifier for the game board
    - JavaScript can select this with: document.getElementById('whack-a-mole')
    - CSS styles this container (green background, border, etc.)
  -->
  <div id="whack-a-mole">
    <!-- 
      INDIVIDUAL HOLES:
      =================
      - Each <div class="hole"> = One hole on the game board
      - class="hole" = Reusable identifier (many elements can share this class)
      - JavaScript selects all holes with: document.querySelectorAll('.hole')
      - CSS styles all holes the same way
      - When a mole appears, JavaScript adds class="mole" to one of these
      - There are 9 holes total = 3x3 grid
    -->
    <div class="hole"></div>
    <div class="hole"></div>
    <div class="hole"></div>
    <div class="hole"></div>
    <div class="hole"></div>
    <div class="hole"></div>
    <div class="hole"></div>
    <div class="hole"></div>
    <div class="hole"></div>
  </div>
</body>
