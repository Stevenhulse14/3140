  WHACK-A-MOLE GAME - CSS STYLESHEET
  ===================================
  
  This file defines the APPEARANCE of the game.
  CSS = Cascading Style Sheets = the skin/clothes of your webpage.
  
  LEARNING GOALS:
  - Understand CSS selectors (element, ID, class)
  - Learn flexbox layout system
  - Understand how to use background images
  - Practice CSS properties and values
  
  CSS RULE STRUCTURE:
  selector {
    property: value;
    property: value;
  }

/* 
  ============================================
  BODY STYLES (The entire page)
  ============================================
  
  SELECTOR: body = Targets the <body> HTML element
*/
body {
  /* 
    FLEXBOX LAYOUT:
    ===============
    display: flex = Makes body a flex container
    This allows us to easily center content and arrange items
  */
  display: flex;
  
  /* 
    flex-direction: column = Stack children vertically (top to bottom)
    - row = horizontal (left to right) - default
    - column = vertical (top to bottom)
  */

  /* 
    justify-content: center = Centers content along MAIN axis
    - Since flex-direction is column, main axis is vertical
    - This centers content vertically
  */

  /* 
    align-items: center = Centers content along CROSS axis
    - Since flex-direction is column, cross axis is horizontal
    - This centers content horizontally
  */

  /* 
    VIEWPORT UNITS:
    ===============
    - 100vw = 100% of viewport width (full screen width)
    - 100vh = 100% of viewport height (full screen height)
    - These units are responsive (adapt to screen size)
  */

  /* 
    FONT FAMILY:
    ============
    Lists fonts in order of preference
    Browser tries first font, then second, etc.
    'sans-serif' = fallback to any sans-serif font
  */

  GAME BOARD CONTAINER (#whack-a-mole)

    BACKGROUND COLOR:
    =================

  /* 
    BORDER:
    =======
    - solid = Solid line (not dashed or dotted)

    - #000 = Black color (hex code)
    Creates a thick black border around the game board
  */
  border: solid 20px #000;
  
  /* 
    PADDING:
    ========
    Space INSIDE the element (between border and content)

    Creates breathing room between border and holes
  */
  padding: 20px;
  
  /* 
    WIDTH:
    ======
    360px = Fixed width (3 holes × 110px + margins = ~360px)
    This creates a square-ish game board
  */
  width: 360px;
  
  /* 
    FLEXBOX FOR GRID LAYOUT:
    ========================

    Together, this creates a grid: items flow left-to-right, then wrap

  ============================================
  HOLE STYLES (.hole)

  This styles each individual hole on the game board

    BACKGROUND IMAGE:
    =================

    This displays the hole image as the background

  /* 
    BACKGROUND SIZE:
    ================

    Alternative: cover = fills entire area (may crop)
  */
  background-size: contain;
  
  /* 
    DIMENSIONS:
    ===========

  */
  width: 110px;
  height: 123px;
  
  /* 
    MARGIN:
    =======

    Creates gaps between holes so they don't touch

/* 
  ============================================
  MOLE STYLES (.mole)
  ============================================
  
  SELECTOR: .mole = Targets elements with class="mole"
  
  IMPORTANT: This class is ADDED by JavaScript when a mole appears!
  When a hole has BOTH .hole AND .mole classes, it shows the mole image.
  
  CSS CASCADE:
  - .hole sets the base styles (size, position)
  - .mole OVERRIDES the background-image
  - Result: Same size/position, but mole image instead of hole image
*/
.mole {
  /* 
    BACKGROUND IMAGE OVERRIDE:
    ===========================
    When JavaScript adds class="mole" to a hole, this CSS rule applies
    It replaces the hole image with the mole image
    The hole keeps its size/position from .hole, but shows mole.png
  */
  background-image: url("images/mole.png");
  
  /* 
    NOTE: We don't need to repeat width/height/margin here
    because .mole will be ADDED to elements that already have .hole
    CSS cascade: both rules apply, .mole's background-image wins
  */
}

  CSS CONCEPTS SUMMARY:
  ============================================
  
  1. SELECTORS:
     - body = Element selector (all <body> elements)
     - #id = ID selector (one specific element)
     - .class = Class selector (all elements with that class)
  
  2. FLEXBOX:
     - display: flex = Creates flex container
     - flex-direction = Main axis direction
     - justify-content = Alignment on main axis
     - align-items = Alignment on cross axis
     - flex-wrap = Allow wrapping to new line
  
  3. SIZING:
     - px = Pixels (fixed size)
     - vw/vh = Viewport units (responsive)
     - % = Percentage of parent
  
  4. SPACING:
     - margin = Space OUTSIDE element
     - padding = Space INSIDE element
  
  5. BACKGROUNDS:
     - background-color = Solid color
     - background-image = Image file
     - background-size = How to scale image
